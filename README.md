Here you can follow the steps in order to correctly code and execute the program:

1) Open Command Prompt by typing "cmd" at the search bar.

2) If you don't have the "pip" command installed type "python -m pip install -U pip" to download it.

3) Download the OpenCV library by typing "pip install opencv-python" to download the latest OpenCV version. Also install "opencv-contrib-python" by typing "pip install opencv-contrib-python"
   because it fixes multiple errors cause by the versions of the opencv.

4) From this website: https://opencv.org/releases/page/6/ download the opencv(3.2.0) and extract all the content from the file. Find the following file "lbpcascade_frontalface.xml"and copy-paste them
	to the file called "opencv-files" which is located at the Desktop.

5) Install the "numpy" library by typing in the command prompt "pip install numpy"

6) We used VSCode to write and run our code. To successully run the code you need to download the following extensions:
   a)Python Image Preview
   b)Live Share (That's optional. You just need it to make your life easier by writing code together with a colleague)

***It's necessary to have both the latest and the 3.2.0 versions of the OpenCV.

7) We converted our code into an application with the following steps:
   a) open command prompt typing "cmd" at the search bar.
   b) type: "pyinstaller --onefile "nameofthefile".py
